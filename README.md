##  What is LucasOS?

LucasOS is a retro-inspired fake operating system built entirely in the browser using React + TailwindCSS.
It's a playful developer playground where I showcase my projects, terminal UI ideas, design skills, and inject a lot of fun â€” with a nostalgic nod to classic interfaces like Windows 95/98.
The Design is heavily inspired by caelestial-dots/shell
